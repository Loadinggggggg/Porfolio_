# Porfolio
Introduction:

Welcome to my portfolio, where I showcase my humble passion for data analysis. Through my projects, I AIM to learn new technologies and analytical techniques to extract valuable insights and make data-driven decisions. My portfolio reflects my dedication to continuous learning and my interest to solve problems in various domains. Here, below is an overview of each project.

1) Python
   
   a) Sentimental Analysis: ne of the standout projects in my portfolio is a sentimental analysis of movies using machine learning. The aim of this project was to develop a model        capable of predicting the sentiment associated with movie reviews. By employing sophisticated machine learning algorithms, I harnessed the power of data to gain insights           into the sentiments expressed in the reviews.
      Through careful preprocessing and feature engineering, I transformed textual data into a format suitable for analysis. Leveraging natural language processing techniques, I         trained a machine learning model to classify movie reviews as positive or negative. This allowed for a comprehensive understanding of the sentiment associated with different       movies. The project showcases my expertise in machine learning, data analysis, and natural language processing. It demonstrates my ability to navigate complex datasets,            implement advanced algorithms, and derive meaningful insights from textual data. Further, it presents an intresting observation for the overal sentimental analysis concept,        and its respectivelly ethical reflection.

3) R
   
   a) Hotel.R: This R-based project involves the analysis of a hotel bookings dataset using various packages like `readr`, `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, and `tidyr`. The dataset is loaded         from a CSV file and contains information about hotel bookings, including lead time, arrival date, number of guests, meal type, distribution channel, guest status,                  deposit type, and  more. The project's main objectives are to gain insights from the data and visualize booking patterns. It starts with basic insights like the                    average lead time and the most popular booking month, etc. Visualizations include the distribution of adults, children, and babies, number of bookings by meal type,                distribution channel, and guest status,as well as the cancellation rate by month.
      Additionally, the project explores the average daily rate by customer and deposit type, booking changes distribution, cancellation rate by market segment, and a correlation        heatmap for numerical variables. Overall, this project demonstrates proficiency in data loading, wrangling, and visualization techniques in R. It showcases the ability to          analyze real-world datasets and extract valuable insights to understand hotel booking patterns and customer behavior.

4) SQL
   
   a) Supermarket_analysis.sql This SQL-based project involves querying a database table named 'Supermarket' to gain insights into the supermarket's sales performance, customer          demographics, and product popularity. The table contains various columns such as Branch, City, Customer type, Gender, Product Line, Date, Total Sales, Cost of Goods Sold           (COGS), Gross Income, Rating, Payment method, Quantity, and others.
      To accomplish the analysis, the project utilizes SQL skills and knowledge, including the use of `SELECT` statements to retrieve specific columns, `GROUP BY` clause for             grouping data, and aggregate functions like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, and `AVG()` to calculate statistics within each group. The ORDER BY clause is applied to sort the query             results, and the CASE statement is used for data categorization based on specified conditions. `DATE_FORMAT()` function is utilized to format dates, and subqueries are used        for calculating statistics related to different groupings. The project showcases the application of SQL to perform various analytical tasks, such as aggregations, filtering,       sorting, and grouping data. The insights derived from these queries provide valuable information for making informed business decisions and optimizing supermarket operations.
